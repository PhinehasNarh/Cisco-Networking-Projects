Welcome to my Cisco Packet Tracer project on designing a university campus network! In this project, I created a robust setup that includes a main campus router, cloud services with an email server, and a multi-switch system connected to various departments, each with their own VLANs.

Here’s how I put it all together:

Step 1: Setting Up the Main Campus Router
I started by adding a router to the workspace, linking it to the internet, and creating a VLAN specifically for the router. After assigning the VLAN an IP address, I connected the router to the multi-switch that would serve the departments.

Step 2: Setting Up the Multi-Switch with VLANs
Next, I added a multi-layer switch to the workspace and linked it to the main campus router. Then, I set up VLANs to segment each department, including admin, HR, finance, health & sciences, business, computer science, the student lab, staff offices, and the IT department. Each VLAN was mapped to specific ports on the multi-switch—for instance, ports 1-5 for the admin department and 6-10 for HR.

Step 3: Connecting Cloud Services with an Email Server
With the basic structure in place, I brought in cloud services by adding a cloud node connected to the main campus router. I added an email server to the cloud node, linking it to the internet to provide reliable email services for campus communications.

Step 4: Connecting Departments to the Multi-Switch
Once the VLANs were configured, I connected each department to the multi-switch by adding a switch to each department and linking it to the correct VLAN.

Step 5: Configuring IP Addresses for Each Department
Each department switch received its own IP address, and I set the main campus router as the default gateway, ensuring a streamlined network path for each department.

Step 6: Testing the Network
Finally, it was time for testing. I opened the command prompt on a computer within each department’s network and tried pinging other computers. A successful ping confirmed each department was properly connected and that network communication was seamless.

And that’s it—a fully functional university campus network! With a main router, VLAN-enabled multi-switch, email server, and department-specific networks, the setup ensures smooth communication and enhanced security across the campus.

Welcome to my Cisco Packet Tracer project on designing an "Estate Residence Network"! I set out to create a streamlined network for an estate, with everything from switches and servers to access points and a cell tower, all tailored to support IoT devices, smartphones, and more.

Here’s a look at the process:

1. Starting the Project
I kicked things off by creating a new project in Cisco Packet Tracer and gave it the name "Estate Residence Network."

2. Adding a Switch
Next, I dragged a switch from the "Switches and Hubs" category into the workspace and opened up its configuration settings.

3. Securing the Switch
To keep things secure, I set up an encrypted password for the switch by navigating to the "Security" tab and selecting "Password." After entering a strong password, I hit "Apply" to lock in the settings.

4. Setting Up the Estate Server
I brought an estate server into the workspace from the "Servers" category and connected it to the switch. To do this, I clicked on the estate server, selected the "Connections" tab, and linked its Ethernet port to an Ethernet port on the switch.

5. Configuring the Estate Server
The estate server was then set up to control and manage data from IoT devices. I installed necessary software, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and configured it to handle data storage for IoT devices on the network.

6. Adding Access Points
I added three access points labeled "Management," "Maintenance," and "Residence" from the "Wireless Devices" category.

7. Connecting Access Points to the Network
Each access point was linked to the switch by selecting its "Connections" tab and connecting its Ethernet port to one of the switch’s Ethernet ports.

8. Configuring the Access Points
I set up each access point to allow remote access to the IoT devices by configuring wireless settings like SSID, encryption, and password.

9. Adding a Cell Tower
Next, I dragged a cell tower from the "End Devices" category into the workspace and connected it to the switch by linking its Ethernet port to one of the switch’s Ethernet ports.

10. Configuring the Cell Tower
The cell tower was set up to provide mobile connectivity to smartphones by configuring cellular settings, such as carrier, frequency band, and access point name.

11. Testing the Network
Finally, I tested the network by connecting IoT devices, smartphones, and other devices to the access points, making sure they could all communicate with the estate server and interact seamlessly.

And there it is—a fully functional "Estate Residence Network" complete with a secure switch, a data-storing server, access points for various estate zones, and mobile connectivity from a cell tower, all set up to support IoT devices and more.

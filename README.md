# 🕸️ Network Design Adventures!

## 🚀 Project Overview
Welcome to my collection of network design journeys, crafted with Cisco Packet Tracer and a little sprinkle of tech wizardry! Here, you'll find a mix of campus, residential, and high-security networks, each with its own unique setup. Think of this as a sampler of network awesomeness—whether it's connecting IoT coffee machines or building firewalls around sensitive state data, there's something here for every network enthusiast.

#### NOTE: Each .pkt file includes a corresponding documentation file with the same name, so you’ll have a detailed guide right at your fingertips for every network design.

## 🖥️ Networks Included
1. **🎓 University Campus Network**:
   - Designed to keep a busy campus connected—from student dorms to faculty offices and cloud services.
   - Set up with VLANs, department-specific subnets, and a dedicated server for email, DNS, and web needs. 

2. **📡 Telecommunications Network (Vodafone Ghana)**:
   - A robust, cloud-based setup for a telco, connecting the central office and cell towers to departments like customer service and operations.
   - Locked down with encrypted connections and firewalls to keep everything *secure and sound*.

3. **🕵️‍♂️ State Security Network**:
   - Two exclusive networks crafted for Police and Intelligence agencies, connected to a government database.
   - Equipped with access points, PCs, smart devices, and high-level security, keeping things confidential and controlled.

4. **🏠 Phinehas & Parker Residence Network**:
   - The ultimate residential network for managing IoT devices, with a secure residence server and two access points.
   - Handles everything from coffee makers to fans, with password-protected fun and a secure firewall in the mix.

5. **🏢 Residential Estate Network**:
   - An estate-wide network featuring a powerful server, main switch, and access points for management, maintenance, and resident access.
   - Designed to handle all IoT data and provide remote access to devices, keeping residents connected and satisfied.

## 🌟 Cool Features & Highlights
- **Custom VLANs & Subnetting Magic**: Each network has neatly organized VLANs and subnetting to keep things efficient and smooth.
- **Device Variety Galore**: PCs, smartphones, laptops, IoT gadgets, cell towers—you name it, I connected it!
- **Bulletproof Security**: With passwords, firewalls, and encrypted connections on each network, only the right people get in.
- **Fully Tested & Ready**: All networks have been put through the wringer, ensuring they connect, protect, and deliver just as they should.

## 🛠️ How to Use
Dive into any network setup to learn, replicate, or tweak for your own projects. Each design is fully documented and can be easily customized to fit different environments. Think of this repository as your network design sandbox—test, explore, and have fun connecting the dots!
